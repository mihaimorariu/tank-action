# Tank Action #

This game was implemented by my good old friend, [Andrei](https://github.com/aoghina), back when he was a high school student. All credits go to him for creating this awesome piece of software.

My only contribution (and goal) was to make the code compile (again), in an attempt to see if I still remember how to program in Pascal.

Sadly, there are still some bugs which prevent the game from being playable. I need to take time and understand the code. If I ever have too much time to spare, I will fix them and make the game playable (again).

## Dependencies ##

- Free Pascal (fpc)

You can get the Free Pascal compiler with the following command:

- Arch: `sudo pacman -S fpc`
- Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install fp-compiler`

## Building ##

`cd src && fpc tank.pas`

## Running ##

`cd src && ./tank`
